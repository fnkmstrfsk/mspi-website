# MSPI Marketing Content

## Core Positioning

**MSPI = MSP + AI = Intelligence Multiplied**

We're not replacing your tools. We're the AI intelligence layer that sits on top of your existing stack—watching, connecting, and cultivating while you sleep.

**Key positioning statement:** MSPI sits on top of your existing PSA, RMM, and billing tools. What becomes obsolete isn't Autotask or ConnectWise—it's the endless clicking through their restrained interfaces. We give you a new layer to interact with your business.

## The Cultivation Model (Core Narrative)

### The Problem: Seeds That Rot

Every day at an MSP plants seeds:
- A technician takes a call (seed: billable time)
- A customer adds a user (seed: license revenue)
- A device checks in (seed: managed service value)
- A backup runs (seed: contractual obligation fulfilled)

**Left untended, seeds rot.** Time entries get forgotten. License changes slip through. New customers get services before agreements are signed. Technicians round down because they're being "fair."

### Old Way: Forensic Monthly Reconciliation

Friday afternoon. Four-hour slog through spreadsheets. Comparing Pax8 to Autotask to QuickBooks, looking for mismatches. Finding $2,000-3,000 in unbilled items every month—but missing things too. Hating Fridays.

### MSPI Way: Daily Cultivation

No Friday reconciliation. Every day is a small harvest. Gaps caught when they're 1 day old, not 30. License changes flow through automatically. New customers invoiced on day one.

**Five minutes approving. Maybe fifteen if there are judgment calls.**

The Slivers cultivate. You harvest.

## A Day in the Life (Narrative for Website)

*How a fleet of small AI specialists tends an MSP's revenue garden*

### 6:47 AM — The Garden Awakens

Mike hasn't had his coffee yet, but his Slivers have already been working for hours.

Yesterday was busy. Three technicians in the field. Two emergency calls. A new customer onboarded. Microsoft pushed license changes. Someone's backup failed at 2 AM.

All of that activity created **potential revenue**. Seeds planted in the ground. The Slivers' job? Make sure every seed becomes a harvest.

### Yesterday: Jake Takes an Emergency Call

Jake, senior tech, gets a call. Workstation won't boot at a medical practice. He remotes in, diagnoses a corrupted Windows profile, rebuilds it. Forty-five minutes of skilled work.

He opens Autotask to log a ticket. But his next call is already ringing—emergency, server down. He'll log the ticket later.

He forgets.

**But the RMM didn't forget.**

The Sensor Sliver watched the remote session. It saw the connection, the 47-minute duration, the tools launched. This gets recorded as an **unticketed work event**. A seed that needs tending.

### Yesterday: The License Changes Rain Down

Microsoft pushes license changes across three accounts:
- Client A: +3 licenses (billable event, needs agreement amendment)
- Client B: -2 licenses (credit to issue proactively, before they complain)
- Client C: Tier upgrade on 15 seats (monthly impact: +$97.50)

The Detector Sliver examines each. The consensus engine convenes—multiple models that must agree before action.

Alerts created. Not as "problems"—as **growth events that need harvesting**.

### Yesterday: Jake Rounds Down

Jake spent 3 hours 33 minutes at the server emergency. He logs 3 hours—being conservative, accounting for breaks.

The Documentation Sliver notices the gap. 33 minutes at $175/hour emergency rate is $96.25.

It doesn't correct Jake's entry. It creates a **documentation gap alert** for the owner to review. Not accusatory. Just observable facts with evidence.

### 6:47 AM — The Harvest Report

Mike opens his laptop. He doesn't see nine Slivers. He sees a **Cultivation Report**:

```
DAILY CULTIVATION REPORT

YIELDS READY FOR HARVEST
  License True-Up: Client A - $126.00 (prorated)
  Tier Upgrade: Client C - $97.50/month increase
  New Customer Setup: Ready for first invoice

NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION
  Documentation Gap: Jake logged 3.0 hours, RMM shows 3.55
  Unticketed Work: 47-minute session, no ticket found

CREDITS TO ISSUE
  Client B: -2 licenses, credit $18.00

Estimated harvestable revenue: $2,681.50
```

Mike's Friday reconciliation is now a Tuesday morning coffee ritual. Five minutes. Approve, approve, review, approve.

## The Slivers (AI Agent Fleet)

Nine specialists, each with one job:

| Sliver | Watches | Cultivates |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Sensor:PSA** | Tickets, time, agreements | Raw work data |
| **Sensor:Distributor** | Subscriptions, licenses | What you pay for |
| **Sensor:Accounting** | Invoices, payments | What you've billed |
| **Sensor:RMM** | Devices, sessions, alerts | Actual activity |
| **Resolver** | Entity relationships | Unified customer view |
| **Detector** | Gaps between systems | Revenue opportunities |
| **Reviewer** | Alert validity | Confidence in findings |
| **Proposer** | Billing actions | Drafts for approval |
| **Reporter** | Human communication | The daily harvest report |

**Key principle:** Every Sliver runs consensus—multiple models that must agree before proceeding. If they disagree, they stop and ask the owner. No single point of failure. No action without permission.

## ISO 27001: AI on Rails

### The Guardrails Message

> Think of it like a bobsled on an ISO 27001 luge track. Go as fast as you dare. Do whatever you want with your sled. You won't jump out of the track.

### Key Points

1. **Continuous vs Point-in-Time**
   - SOC 2 = point-in-time attestation (compliance theater)
   - ISO 27001 = continuous ISMS (Information Security Management System)
   - We show up at audits. That's what real fiduciaries do.

   - Enterprise-grade security governance extended to every client you touch

3. **Measurable Business Maturity**
   - We measurably raise your clients' business maturity level
   - What six-figure ops consultants fantasize about

## Platform Positioning

### What MSPI Is
- An intelligence layer that sits ON TOP of your existing stack
- A new interface for interacting with your business data
- AI agents that watch, connect, and cultivate 24/7
- Daily harvests instead of monthly forensics

### What MSPI Is NOT
- A replacement for Autotask, ConnectWise, or your PSA
- A replacement for your RMM or Datto
- Another tool that bolts onto your stack
- Something that requires ripping out existing infrastructure

### The Layer Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         MSPI Layer              │  ← Intelligence, cultivation
│   (watches, connects, reports)  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     Your Existing Stack         │  ← Still needed, still works
│  PSA | RMM | Billing | Cloud    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Competitive Positioning

### Blue Ocean Response

**MSP Question:** "If I adopt MSPI, how long until you sell it to my competitors?"

**Response:** The question isn't whether your competitors will get it. It's whether you get it first.

MSPI sits on top of your existing stack. Your tools stay exactly where they are. What becomes obsolete is the endless clicking through their interfaces. We give you a new intelligence layer—one that watches, connects, and cultivates while you sleep.

### Against Traditional Operations

| Traditional MSP | MSPI-Powered MSP |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Friday reconciliation (4 hours) | Tuesday morning review (5 minutes) |
| Find problems after 30 days | Catch gaps at 1 day old |
| Technicians round down | Every minute documented |
| License changes slip through | Auto-detected and drafted |
| Manual entity matching | Unified customer view |

4. **Validate**: 3-model consensus before action
5. **Harvest**: Capture every dollar owed—with owner approval
