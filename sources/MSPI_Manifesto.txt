MSPI Manifesto

The MSP industry is poisoned.

Tooling is fucked. Gap in your stack? New tool—another $4/seat of margin gone. Great features, hyper-specialized. Then the monoliths buy it and innovation dies. Same cycle for years. Roadmaps frozen. Features crawling while the world moves at lightspeed.

And MSPs? Even the “good” ones pulling 15-25% net margins are bleeding out on manual waste: unbilled time, license gaps, semi-automated invoicing at best, scope creep, engineers hoarding tribal knowledge, no real documentation, guessed tickets, endless queues, escalation hell.

You were once THE trusted advisors. Now you’re drowning in projects you already billed for—money already spent—while your unhappy clients quietly shop competitors.

Youre supposed to watch over their infrastructure and protect their business. But you didn’t even notice the “competitor-admin” account they created last month to get quotes.

MSPI is the antidote.

AI intelligence layer on whatever broken stack you’re running—automates ops overnight.

Unbilled minutes? Auto-captured. License leaks? Daily alerts + remediation. Scope creep? Dead before invoice. Engineers who ghost handoffs? Forced structure: auto-notes, KB capture from every fix, clean transitions. Tribal knowledge dies.

vCIO theater? Razed. vCAIOs rise from the ashes. We’re talking real QBRs (not template theater), whitespace hunting, shadow IT governance, 3-year roadmaps, ROI dashboards clients actually believe.

We turn cost-center MSPs into AI-powered profit engines: agentic runbooks, drift detection, AI orchestration. Multiplying your margins while finally delivering the experience you promised and keep failing to deliver.

How this impacts you as an MSP

Your clients are leaving. ChatGPT just showed them the exit clause in your MSA. Your blind spots are fatal. We’re coming for the whole industry.

Evolve with us—or fire-sale your assets.

In the next 3 months, I’ll be meeting your customers. I’ll show up with a thumb drive. When I leave, they’ll have a specialized gap analysis, quote, statement of work, and MSA my AI started generating the moment I walked in. When they’re ready to sign, they run the program and onboarding starts. The AI self-deploys. We’ll have their entire business mapped within 24 hours. Not their technology—their business. I don’t need your process or documentation. It’s old, outdated, and I don’t trust it. Your focus is on tooling and process. Our focus is on outcomes.

So, you still think you have a chance? You think your customers are too scared of AI to value it? You think you can tell them it’s too risky to deter them from leaving?

MSPI is ISO 27001 certified and so will every service and infrastructure we manage for your former customers.

We’re not talking about your SOC 2 attestation, a point-in-time snapshot. We’re talking about ISO 27001: a continuous, internationally recognized information security management system. We just extended enterprise-grade security governance to your clients. We just measurably increased their business maturity level in a way that your six-figure ops and process consultants have fantasies about.

Because that’s what real fiduciaries do. They keep their clients safe from harm known and unknown. They put them above their profit margins. We take the Ferrari and let idiots drive it without fear of death, because we put it on redundant safety rails.

Good luck with that

We are MSPI. We just launched. No one saw us coming. We’re not leaving.

Your operating model that’s been around since Windows XP is obsolete. We will take your customers and tweet about it the entire time. There is nothing you can do to stop us. We are the latest in technology. You are Adobe Flash.
